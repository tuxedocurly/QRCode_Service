This is the *QRCode Service* project I made myself.


<p>This project utilizes QR codes â€” 2D barcodes that can store large amounts of data and are easily read by smartphones. Through this Spring Boot project, I learned about the technology behind QR codes, generated them programmatically, and created an API I will eventually integrate into a web service.</p><br/><br/>
